For starters, returning to BASIC will change the top bank to bank 7. It will also automatically select ROM 0
for you, so no need to set bit 4. Most importantly, you need to disable interrupts and keep the system variable
at 23388 updated with the value you send to the port.

I recommend you write a small MC loader and stick it into BASIC. Then run the whole thing with
RANDOMIZE USR (PEEK 23635+256*PEEK 23636+5).
