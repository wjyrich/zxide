* Implement memory editing in the memory view
* In the memory view highlight symbol when mouse is over a hexadecimal value and vise-versa
* Implement breakpoints
* Run to cursor is currently inaccurate
* Disassembly window (?)
* Watch window with symbols (?)
* Navigation through source (?), back/forward buttons (?)
* Show the corresponding label in the stack window
* Drag and drop in the file list
* Remove non-empty directories in the file list
* Multiple file selection in the file list (?)
* Implement support for unnamed sections
* Implement elseif (?)
* When error happens in the generated file we should open that file
* Implement project settings
* Search and search-with-replace in the text editor
* Import and dither-to-monochrome images
* Flip and rotation in the tile editor should work only on a selected area
* Support memory banks in the debug info
* Grid in the level editor
* Tile selector in the level editor has overlapping name strings
* Level editor is hardcoded to 16x16 tiles
* No code generation for tiles, tilesets and maps
* When highlighting an error, set cursor to the first non-space character in the string
* Do not open file after renaming if it was not previously open
* In the compiler when evaluating equ constants immediately, symbol from other files could be undefined
  (this is non-deterministic, depends on file order which maybe different between different runs)
* Some 'equ in if' tests fail
* Hardware selection in the settings (48K / 128K)
* Cleanup old files in the 'generated' directory
